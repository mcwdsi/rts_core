@TABLE
TABLE_NAME	TABLE_DESCRIPTION	TABLE_ORDER
DEMOGRAPHIC	Demographics record the direct attributes of individual patients.	1
ENCOUNTER	Encounters are interactions between patients and providers within the context of healthcare delivery.	2
ENROLLMENT	Enrollment is a concept that defines a period of time during which a person is expected to have complete data capture. This concept is often insurance-based, but other methods of defining enrollment are possible.	3
DIAGNOSIS	Diagnosis codes indicate the results of diagnostic processes and medical coding within healthcare delivery. Data in this table are expected to be from healthcare-mediated processes and reimbursement drivers.	4
PROCEDURES	Procedure codes indicate the discrete medical interventions and diagnostic testing, such as surgical procedures and lab orders, delivered within a healthcare context.	5
VITAL	Vital signs (such as height, weight, and blood pressure) directly measure an individual’s current state of attributes.	6
DISPENSING	Prescriptions filled through a community, mail-order or hospital pharmacy. Outpatient dispensing may not be directly captured within healthcare systems.	7
LAB_RESULT_CM	This table is used to store quantitative and qualitative measurements from blood and other body specimens.	8
CONDITION	A condition represents a patient’s diagnosed and self-reported health conditions and diseases. The patient’s medical history and current state may both be represented.	9
PRO_CM	This table is used to store responses to patient-reported outcome measures (PROs) or questionnaires. This table can be used to store item-level responses as well as the overall score for each measure.	10
PRESCRIBING	Provider orders for medication dispensing and/or administration. These orders may take place in any setting, including the inpatient or outpatient basis.	11
PCORNET_TRIAL	Patients who are enrolled in PCORnet clinical trials and PCORnet studies.	12
DEATH	Reported mortality information for patients.	13
DEATH_CAUSE	The individual causes associated with a reported death.	14
MED_ADMIN	Records of medications administered to patients by healthcare providers. These administrations may take place in any setting, including inpatient, outpatient or home health encounters.	15
PROVIDER	Data about the providers who are involved in the care processes documented in the CDM.	16
OBS_CLIN	Standardized qualitative and quantitative clinical observations about a patient.	17
OBS_GEN	Table to store everything else.	18
HASH_TOKEN	Encrypted hash tokens that are used to match patient records across DataMarts using privacy-preserving record linkage methods.	19
LDS_ADDRESS_HISTORY	Longitudinal record of a patient’s address that adheres to the requirements of a Limited Data Set.	20
IMMUNIZATION	Records of immunizations that have been delivered within the health system as well as reports of those administered elsewhere.	21
HARVEST	Attributes associated with the specific PCORnet datamart implementation, including data refreshes.	22
FACILITY	A synthesized table made by projection of just facility fields from ENCOUNTER table and then sorting into unique rows	23

DEMOGRAPHIC	PATID	RDBMS Text(x)	SAS Char(x)		NO				Arbitrary person-level identifier used to link across tables.  PATID is a pseudoidentifier with a consistent crosswalk to the true identifier retained by the source data partner. For analytical data sets requiring patient-level data, only the pseudoidentifier is used to link across all information belonging to a patient. The PATID must be unique within each PCORnet data mart. Creating a unique identifier within a network would be beneficial and acceptable. The PATID is not the basis for linkages across data partners.	1

Details of categorical definitions: Ambulatory Visit: Includes visits at outpatient clinics, physician offices, same day/ambulatory surgery centers, urgent care facilities, and other same-day ambulatory hospital encounters, but excludes emergency department encounters. Emergency Department (ED): Includes ED encounters that become inpatient stays (in which case inpatient stays would be a separate encounter). Excludes urgent care facility visits. ED claims should be pulled before hospitalization claims to ensure that ED with subsequent admission won't be rolled up in the hospital event. Does not include observation stays, where known (guidance added in v3.1). Emergency Department Admit to Inpatient Hospital Stay: Permissible substitution for preferred state of separate ED and IP records. Only for use with data sources where the individual records for ED and IP cannot be distinguished. Inpatient Hospital Stay: Includes all inpatient stays, including: same-day hospital discharges, hospital transfers, and acute hospital care where the discharge is after the admission date. Does not include observation stays, where known (guidance added in v3.1). Observation Stay: “Hospital outpatient services given to help the doctor decide if the patient needs to be admitted as an inpatient or can be discharged. Observations services may be given in the emergency department or another area of the hospital.” Definition from Medicare, CMS Product No. 11435, https://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/11435.pdf (new value set item added in v3.1). Institutional Professional Consult: Permissible substitution when services provided by a medical professional cannot be combined with the given encounter record, such as a specialist consult in an inpatient setting; this situation can be common with claims data sources (new value set item added in v3.1). Non-Acute Institutional Stay: Includes hospice, skilled nursing facility (SNF), rehab center, nursing home, residential, overnight non-hospital dialysis, and other non-hospital stays. Other Ambulatory Visit: Includes other non-overnight AV encounters such as hospice visits, home health visits, skilled nursing visits, other non-hospital visits, as well as telemedicine, telephone and email consultations. May also include "lab only" visits (when a lab is ordered outside of a patient visit), "pharmacy only" (e.g., when a patient has a refill ordered without a face-to-face visit), "imaging only", etc.	25

Details of categorical definitions: Medical insurance coverage: The start and stop dates are based upon enrollment where the health plan has any responsibility for covering medical care for the member during this enrollment period (i.e., if you expect to observe medical care provided to this member during the enrollment period). Outpatient prescription drug coverage: The start and stop dates are based on enrollment where the health plan has any responsibility for covering outpatient prescription drugs for the member during this enrollment period (i.e., if you expect to observe outpatient pharmacy dispensings for this member during this enrollment period). (New value set item added in v3.1.) Geography: An assertion of complete data capture between the start and end dates based upon geographic characteristics, such as regional isolation. Algorithmic: An assertion of complete data capture between the start and end dates, based on a locally developed or applied algorithm, often using multiple criteria. Encounter-based: The start and stop dates are populated from the earliest-observed encounter and latest-observed encounter. Field definition and value sets modified in v3.1 to include drug coverage.	52

We include a number of code types for flexibility, but the basic requirement that the code refer to a medical procedure remains. Revenue codes are a standard concept in Medicare billing and can be useful for defining care settings. If those codes are available they can be included. Medications administered by clinicians can be captured in billing data and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as HCPCS procedure codes. Administration (infusion) of chemotherapy is an example.  We are now seeing NDCs captured as part of procedures because payers are demanding it for payment authorization. Inclusion of this code type enables those data partners that capture the NDC along with the procedure to include the data. Please note: The “Other” category is meant to identify internal use ontologies and codes. Value set modified in v3.1 to combine CPT and HCPCS codes into one category; also, ICD-9 value set item typo corrected to ICD-9-PCS.	79
